# StudyMatch
Building a platform to connect academically motivated students at UofT.

Problem Statement:
Many university students struggle to find reliable and compatible study partners beyond their immediate friend groups or course-specific group chats. Existing solutions such as Discord servers, forums, or social media are unstructured, short-lived, and poorly suited for forming consistent academic collaborations. These platforms make it difficult for students to discover peers with matching courses, study habits, availability, and learning preferences, often leading to inefficient study sessions or studying in isolation. StudyMatch addresses this gap by providing a dedicated web application that enables University of Toronto students to discover and connect with compatible study partners through structured profiles and persistent academic connections.

How it works

The application manages user authentication, profile data, and connection requests through a Node.js backend with the Express framework and a PostgreSQL database, enabling persistent profiles and stateful interactions. Once connected, students can coordinate study sessions through the platform, providing a structured and reliable alternative to ad-hoc group chats or forum posts.
